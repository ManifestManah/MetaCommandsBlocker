# [Plugin Commands Blocker]
## About
With the Plugin Commands Blocker plugin installed, and running on your server. 
Players will no longer be able to use commands in their player console in order to acquire information regarding your server's metamod or sourcemod version, nor the loaded plugins and modules.
Nor will administrators with the generic administrator access flag be able to view a list of your server's CounterStrikeSharp plugins. 
Only administrators with the Root permission will be able to do this.


## Disclaimer
I am aware that this is a controversial type of plugin, and many may dislike the features that it provides. Personally, I am not partial for, nor against it.
But unlike other versions that I have seen in the past, this plugin will not send insults or treat the client in a hostile fashion.
This plugin is bound to be created, by somebody eventually, and by creating this myself I hope to at least provide a more civilized solution.


## Requirements
In order for the plugin to work, you must have the following installed:
- [CounterStrikeSharp](https://docs.cssharp.dev/guides/getting-started/) 


## Installation

1). Download the contents and open the downloaded zip file.
